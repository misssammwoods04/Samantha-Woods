These events gave us the opportunity to share our knowledge of native trees, ecology, and climate resilience with students and families in a fun, accessible way.\nAdditionally, I have been involved in Sprout Up at UCSB as an instructor. UCSB is home to the largest chapter of Sprout Up dedicated to providing environmental education to first and second graders across Goleta. Alongside my teaching team, I introduced topics such as waste management, water conservation, and bee pollination, helping young students build a foundation in sustainability and environmental awareness."

    "text": "For my ENV S 40 course, Critical Thinking and Evidence-Based Reasoning for the Environment, I created a zine titled “Hair Guide for Sustainable Engagement in the Hair Economy”, which explores the environmental impact of synthetic hair commonly used in protective styles by Black women. This project investigates how synthetic hair—produced from plastic—contributes to pollution through toxic chemical emissions during manufacturing and waste accumulation after use.\nWhile synthetic hair is often chosen for its affordability and versatility, its environmental cost is rarely discussed. My goal with this zine was to raise awareness about the ecological footprint of synthetic hair, without vilifying the cultural significance of protective styling. I also included accessible, affordable alternatives and sustainable practices to empower individuals to make informed choices that support both personal expression and environmental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n{group=“zine”} {group=“zine”} {group=“zine”} {group=“zine”} {group=“zine”} {group=“zine”} {group=“zine”} {group=“zine”} {group=“zine”} {group=“zine”} {group=“zine”} {group=“zine”}"
