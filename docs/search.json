For our final assignment, we were encouraged to explore a topic of our choice, and I chose to focus on women’s contributions to the economy—both in formal labor markets and through informal, often undervalued work like caregiving and domestic labor. This project was a meaningful opportunity to honor the economic roles of the women who came before me. Using a family tree format to visualize their impact, I applied a feminist lens to deepen my understanding of economic systems."

    "text": "This most recent project, titled Stress Maps, was created for my Environmental Statistics course in response to an assignment on affective data visualization. We were asked to collect personal data throughout the quarter and design a visual representation that captures our data.\nI centered my project around the question: “Do I leave campus more often when I feel stressed?” My response variable was my daily stress level, while the predictor variables included the number of assignments and social plans I had each day, the purpose of any off-campus travel, and my method of transportation.\nI visualized each day as its own “roadmap,” using a set of icons to represent different data dimensions. The car, bus, person, and home icons indicates whether I left campus and how I traveled. The windiness of each road reflected the number of assignments I had that day—more loops represented a heavier workload. The color of each road corresponded to my self-reported stress level, on a scale from 1 to 10."

This model allowed me to test whether there is a correlation between my predictor (stress level) and my outcome (leaving campus).\nI calculated the odds ratio, which tells me how the odds of leaving campus change with a one-unit increase in stress. The odds ratio was 1, indicating that stress level has no effect on the likelihood of leaving campus.\nI confirmed this by looking at the predicted probabilities for different stress levels. Each level produced the same predicted probability, suggesting that stress has no statistically significant impact on the outcome.\nBased on this analysis, I found no evidence of a correlation between stress level and the likelihood of leaving campus.\n\nclean_p_data &lt;- clean_p_data |&gt;\n  mutate(leave_iv_campus_home = as.factor(leave_iv_campus_home))\n\np_mod &lt;- glm(leave_iv_campus_home ~ stress_level,\n             data = clean_p_data,\n             family = \"binomial\")\n\nplot(\n  simulateResiduals(p_mod)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary(p_mod)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = leave_iv_campus_home ~ stress_level, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = clean_p_data)\n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

This project investigates how synthetic hair—produced from plastic—contributes to pollution through toxic chemical emissions during manufacturing and waste accumulation after use.\nWhile synthetic hair is often chosen for its affordability and versatility, its environmental cost is rarely discussed. My goal with this zine was to raise awareness about the ecological footprint of synthetic hair, without vilifying the cultural significance of protective styling. I also included accessible, affordable alternatives and sustainable practices to empower individuals to make informed choices that support both personal expression and environmental health.\nFeel free to click through the pages!"
