    "text": "I created this zine titled, “A Sort of How-To to Hooking Up and Hookup Culture + Some Hookup Reminders” for my Sex, Love, and Romance course during the spring quarter of my freshman year. After observing how many of my peers were engaging in hookup culture, I realized how much knowledge—emotional, physical, and cultural—is needed to navigate it thoughtfully. This zine became a way for me to process and make sense of that behavior, especially as I adjusted to a new environment and social landscape.\nClick through the pages!"

These events gave us the opportunity to share our knowledge of native trees, ecology, and climate resilience with students and families in a fun, accessible way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and other YCT members conducting tree maintenance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and other YCT members planting a tree and setting up a tree gator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and other YCT members carrying irrigation piping\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, I have been involved in Sprout Up at UCSB as an instructor.

    "text": "I created this piece, titled “Women as Mothers of the Economy,” as my final project for my Introduction to Economics course during the past winter quarter. For our final assignment, we were encouraged to explore a topic of our choice, and I chose to focus on women’s contributions to the economy—both in formal labor markets and through informal, often undervalued work like caregiving and domestic labor. This project was a meaningful opportunity to honor the economic roles of the women who came before me. Using a family tree format to visualize their impact, I applied a feminist lens to deepen my understanding of economic systems."

For the assignment, we were asked to design an affective visualization based on personal data collected throughout the quarter. I centered my project around the question: “Do I leave campus more often when I feel stressed?” My response variable was my daily stress level, and my predictor variables included the number of assignments and social plans each day, the purpose of my travel off campus, and my method of transportation. This project allowed me to visualize how academic and social pressures influence my movement patterns and emotional well-being."

This project investigates how synthetic hair—produced from plastic—contributes to pollution through toxic chemical emissions during manufacturing and waste accumulation after use.\nWhile synthetic hair is often chosen for its affordability and versatility, its environmental cost is rarely discussed. My goal with this zine was to raise awareness about the ecological footprint of synthetic hair, without vilifying the cultural significance of protective styling. I also included accessible, affordable alternatives and sustainable practices to empower individuals to make informed choices that support both personal expression and environmental health.\nFeel free to click through the pages!"
