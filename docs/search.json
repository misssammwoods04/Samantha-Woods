These events gave us the opportunity to share our knowledge of native trees, ecology, and climate resilience with students and families in a fun, accessible way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, I have been involved in Sprout Up at UCSB as an instructor. UCSB is home to the largest chapter of Sprout Up dedicated to providing environmental education to first and second graders across Goleta. Alongside my teaching team, I introduced topics such as waste management, water conservation, and bee pollination, helping young students build a foundation in sustainability and environmental awareness.\n\n\n\n\n\n{.lightbox style=“display: block; margin: auto;” group=“sprout” description=” Sprout Up Fall 2024”}\n\n\n\n\n\n {.lightbox style=“display: block; margin: auto;” group=“sprout” description=“Sprout up Winter 2025”}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and other YCT members conducting tree maintenance\n\n\nMe and other YCT members planting a tree and setting up a tree gator\n\n\nMe and other YCT members carrying irrigation piping\n\n\nSprout Up Fall 2024"

Since moving to Santa Barbara, my primary medium has been Procreate, thanks to its versatility and ease of use—especially important given the limited space in my college apartment to store acrylic paints and canvases. I’ve completed a wide range of projects across different courses, and this felt like the perfect opportunity to showcase that creative work in one place.\nClick on each piece to learn more about my projects!"

    "text": "For my ENV S 40 course, Critical Thinking and Evidence-Based Reasoning for the Environment, I created a zine titled “Hair Guide for Sustainable Engagement in the Hair Economy”, which explores the environmental impact of synthetic hair commonly used in protective styles by Black women. This project investigates how synthetic hair—produced from plastic—contributes to pollution through toxic chemical emissions during manufacturing and waste accumulation after use.\nWhile synthetic hair is often chosen for its affordability and versatility, its environmental cost is rarely discussed. My goal with this zine was to raise awareness about the ecological footprint of synthetic hair, without vilifying the cultural significance of protective styling. I also included accessible, affordable alternatives and sustainable practices to empower individuals to make informed choices that support both personal expression and environmental health.\nFeel free to click through the pages!"
