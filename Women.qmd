I created this piece, titled "Women as Mothers of the Economy," as my final project for my Introduction to Economics course during the past winter quarter. For our final assignment, we were encouraged to explore a topic of our choice, and I chose to focus on women’s contributions to the economy—both in formal labor markets and through informal, often undervalued work like caregiving and domestic labor. This project gave me the perfect opportunity to honor the economic roles of the women who have come before me and to incorporate a feminist lens into my understanding of economic systems.
