Welcome to my gallery!

I created an interactive representation of the art Iâ€™ve made since entering college. Since moving to Santa Barbara, my primary medium has been *Procreate*, thanks to its versatility and ease of use. This is especially important given the limited space in my college apartment to store acrylic paints and canvases. I've completed a wide range of projects across different courses, and this felt like the perfect opportunity to showcase that creative work in one place.
