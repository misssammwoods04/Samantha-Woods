# My Background

I grew up in Whittier, California, alongside my twin sister and our loving parents. I’m especially grateful for the deep appreciation for nature they passed on to me. When my dad wasn’t busy running his orthopedic surgery practice, he was in our yard, cultivating an oasis of fruit trees and ferns. Some of my favorite childhood memories are of picking grapefruits, peaches, lemons, and tangerines with him.

My mom’s compassion for animals was equally influential. Our home was always filled with dogs, and she never hesitated to help any injured animal that crossed our path. I remember nursing birds with broken wings, and rescuing bees and other critters from drowning in the pool, following her example of empathy and care.

Without my parents’ influence, I wouldn’t be pursuing a degree in Environmental Studies. Their passion helped me develop a deep respect for the natural world—and a commitment to protecting it however I can.

# Campus Involvement 

I am currently involved in several environmental organizations across campus.

## Your Children's Trees at UCSB

Over the course of my second year at UCSB, I interned with *Your Children’s Trees*, a community-centered organization dedicated to environmental restoration through tree planting.

As an intern, I actively participated in tree planting initiatives at key ecological and community sites, including Ellwood Butterfly Grove, Ellwood Mesa, North Campus Open Space, Isla Vista Elementary School, and private properties in Isla Vista.

In addition to hands-on restoration work, I also helped engage the local community by representing *Your Children’s Trees* at elementary school Science Nights. These events gave us the opportunity to share our knowledge of native trees, ecology, and climate resilience with students and families in a fun, accessible way.

## Sprout Up at UCSB

Additionally, I have been involved in *Sprout Up* at UCSB as an instructor. UCSB is home to the largest chapter of *Sprout Up* dedicated to providing environmental education to first and second graders across Goleta. Alongside my teaching team, I introduced topics such as waste management, water conservation, and bee pollination, helping young students build a foundation in sustainability and environmental awareness.
