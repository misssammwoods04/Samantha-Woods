This is a sample of my code from my personal data project! I am coding a plot of my data to show to correlation between my hours of sleep and my stress level. 


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)

# read in packages 

```

```{r}
p_data <- read.csv("media/Personal_Data.csv")

clean_p_data <- p_data |> # create new data frame
  clean_names() # standardizes column names - spaces = underscores, make everything lowercase

clean_p_data <- clean_p_data %>%
  mutate(amount_of_sleep = str_trim(amount_of_sleep),  # remove inconsistencies among group names 
         amount_of_sleep = str_to_lower(amount_of_sleep))    # make lowercase if needed

clean_p_data <- clean_p_data %>% # modify data frame
  mutate(amount_of_sleep = fct_relevel(amount_of_sleep, 
                                       "5 hrs", "6 hrs", "7 hrs", 
                                       "8 hrs", "9 hrs", "10 hrs")) # reorder data so that it is represented in numerical order
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = clean_p_data, # data frame
aes(x = amount_of_sleep, # make x-axis = amount of sleep
y = stress_level, # make y-axis = stress level 
color = amount_of_sleep)) + # color 
geom_jitter() +# jitterplot 
  
labs(
  title = "Sleep vs. Stress Levels", # change title
  x = "Hours of Sleep", # change name of x axis
  y = "Stress Level", # change name of y axis
  color = "Amount of Sleep") # change name of legend 

```
